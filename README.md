A tictactoe game with an AI (don't judge it's my first, and in a morpion there is no much possibilities).
She learns from her previous games (not really fast, maybe i can change some things).

To play :
- Install python if you don't have
- Install pygame ("pip install pygame" in commands terminal)
- Launch reset.py (create new bin saves for AI or reinitialize their content (to reset the AI)
- Launch morpion.py
- An input appears : 0-> AI vs Herself, 1->AI vs You, 2-> You vs AI (in first case she starts and in the second, you start)

A tictactoe game with an AI (don't judge it's my first, and in a morpion there is no much possibilities).
She learns from her previous games (not really fast, maybe i can change some things).

To play :
- Install python if you don't have
- Install pygame ("pip install pygame" in commands terminal)
- Launch reset.py (create new bin save for AI or reinitialize it's content (to reset the AI)
- Launch morpion.py
- An input appears : 0-> AI vs Herself, 1->AI vs You, any other input-> You vs AI (in first case she starts and in the second, you start)
- If you choose AI vs Herself, You need to choose if games are displayed (0) or not (any other input) (much faster if not)

If save is corrupted (especially if you stop the execution when he write in the save), the script will create a new save (and say their is an error).
The program display the number of played games since the beginning of the execution of the script.


It's more interesting when the AI starts the game (maybe she can find how to won every time).
